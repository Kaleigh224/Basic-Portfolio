    <p>Kaleigh is 32 years old and lives in Fort Mill, SC. She was a massage therapist for 13 years before she decided to make a huge jump into the world of coding.
        One of her major passions is dog rescue. She has been fostering for several local area rescues since 2013 and has fostered 51 dogs. She started specializing 
        in fostering pregnant and nursing mothers in November 2016 when she pulled a foster who surprised everyone and ended up being pregnant.
