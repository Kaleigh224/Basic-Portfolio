            <p>Kaleigh is 32 years old and lives in Fort Mill, SC. She was a massage therapist for 13 years before she
                decided
                to make a huge jump into the world of coding.
                One of her major passions is dog rescue. She has been fostering for several local area rescues since
                2013 and
                has fostered 51 dogs. She started specializing
                in fostering pregnant and nursing mothers in November 2016, when she pulled a foster who surprised
                everyone and
                ended up being pregnant. Currently,
                Kaleigh
                has taken a break from fostering pregnant/nursing mothers and has a feral mini aussie named Juniper
                that she is
                fostering.
                Juniper came from an Amish puppy mill where she lived in a cage most of her life for 8 years producing
                litter
                after litter until she couldn't produce anymore. Kaleigh's biggest goal when getting any foster is to
                socialize
                and rehabilitate the broken.

            </p>
            <p>Kaleigh made the decision to go into coding in October of 2018. Her brother, who is in IT, nagged
                her for almost 10 years.
                Her keyboarding and computer programming teachers in middle and high school also encouraged her to
                pursue a computer career.

                She used to build websites when she was much younger through small amounts of coding that she was able
                to teach herself online.
                Kaleigh has always had an interest in computers and coding, but never had the drive or confidence to
                try it until recently.
                Kaleigh felt this would be just the challenge that she needed. </p>
